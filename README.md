# What is bubblesort?

It is just a simple algorithm which works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. Basically swapping it with the largest integer.

Example:

[1, 5, 2, 3, 4] = (5 <> 2) = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4] = (5 <> 3) = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4] = (5 <> 4) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# What is selectionsort?

The selection sort algorithm is simple as the bubblesort one, it works by repeatedly finding the minimum elements. In order for it to understand, you may also classify it as going in "ascending order".

Example:

[64, 25, 12, 22, 11] = (11 <> 64) = [11, 25, 12, 22, 64] = (25 <> 12) = [11, 12, 25, 22, 64] = (25 <> 22) = [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
