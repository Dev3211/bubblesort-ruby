# bubblesort-ruby

This bubble sort algorithm is made in Ruby with just some simple lines of code so that whoever views this file can at least understand what is being done.

# What is bubblesort?

It is just a simple algorithm which works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. Basically swapping it with the largest integer.

Example:

[1, 5, 2, 3, 4] = (5 > 2) = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4] = (5 > 3) = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4] = (5 > 4) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
